Right now I'm gearing up for the upcoming semester's course-load by reviewing statistical concepts. So far, I've found [Mostly Harmless Econometrics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3388277-mostly-harmless-econometrics) by Dr. Josh Angrist & Dr. Steve Pischke to be a particularly helpful read.

Aside from pre-coursework, I have a few projects I'm working on. First, I'm analyzing my own Netflix data to identify trends in my watch history throughout the pandemic. Next, I'm looking at Spotify data to see how the listening habits (as measured by top artists and trending genres) differ between regions with separatist movements compared with the rest of the country.

Beyond coding, Iâ€™m taking advantage of a long winter vacation to improve my elementary level Spanish. Since we're spending the month of January in my boyfriend's hometown of Seville, Spain, it seems like as good a time as any to make some serious progress.

Hasta Luego ðŸ‘‹,
Steve
