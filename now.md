As I enter the final semester of my master's program, I've begun working as a Student Researcher for the [Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC)](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/index.html) in Berlin where I contribute to data science projects investigating the intersection between climate change and human health as a member of the Applied Sustainability Science Working Group. Beyond this, I'll be dedicating the majority of my time towards my remaining coursework and completing my [master's thesis](https://github.com/smkerr/Thesis_WorkInProgress). With graduation in June, my studies are quickly coming to a close. I plan to take full advantage of the remaining time to further hone my skills and prepare myself for the German job market following graduation. I'm excited to see what 2024 has in store. ðŸŒ±
