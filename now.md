Following the successful finish to the first year of my master's program, I've started working as a Junior Data Scientist for [CPC Analytics](cpc-analytics.com), a consultancy firm based in Berlin which is focused on global health topics. In my role, I translate global health data into actionable insights for policymakers. I primarily support our partners at the [WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence](https://pandemichub.who.int/) with projects related to global health emergencies including the ongoing Monkeypox outbreak.

Aside from work, I'm taking advantage of summer in Berlin while it lasts. The city truly is a different place when you add in a bit of warmth and sunlight. :sunny:
