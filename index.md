# About

I’m Steve, a self-identified data enthusiast pursuing a MSc. in Data Science for Public Policy at the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in Berlin. I aim to use code to improve public welfare. As a first year master's student, I’ve been diving deeper into Python & R programming languages with a sprinkle of Bash, HTML, and XPath to contribute to the greater good. This website serves as my attempt to showcase my portfolio as I continue to develop my programming skills.

## My interests
I've got a broad range of policy interests aside from the COVID-19 pandemic including:
* demographic analysis
* housing policy
* tax policy
* health policy

## My projects

* <a href="#uk-covid-dashboard">UK COVID dashboard disaggregated by age group</a>
* <a href="#validating-covid-self-tests">Validating COVID self tests using image recognition</a>
