# About :wave:
I'm Steve, a self-proclaimed data enthusiast! I'm pursuing my [MSc. in Data Science for Public Policy](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/mds) at the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in Berlin. Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into Python & R programming languages with the aim of improving public services with data science.

## My interests :mag:
I've got a broad range of policy interests aside from the COVID-19 pandemic including:
* demographic analysis
* housing policy
* tax policy
* government spending

## My projects :construction_worker:
* <a href="/projects.html/#uk-covid-dashboard">UK COVID Dashboard Disaggregated by Age Group</a>
