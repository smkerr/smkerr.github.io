I’m Steve, a 2nd-year [MSc Data Science for Public Policy](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/mds) student at the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in Berlin, Germany and a Student Researcher at the [Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC)](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/index.html) where I work with the Applied Sustainability Science Working Group. Previously, I contributed to data science projects at [CPC Analytics](https://www.cpc-analytics.com/) and served as a teaching assistant for the Hertie School’s [Introduction to Data Science](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/study/course-catalogue/course/course/introduction-to-data-science) course. 

My work has primarily focused on global health, climate change, and the provision of public services in the digital age. I have worked with a wide array of methods including Bayesian modeling, geospatial analysis, natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning. You can learn more about my projects [here](/projects.html).
