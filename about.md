I'm Steve. I attend the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in Berlin where I'm pursuing my [MSc. in Data Science for Public Policy](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/mds).

I graduated from [Pepperdine University](https://www.pepperdine.edu/) with a B.A. in Economics in 2019. Upon graduating, I took up a position with the newly established U.S. Space Force as a procurement analyst where my team negotiated deals with space launch providers on behalf of the National Security Space Launch program. My experience crunching numbers and desire to build on the nascent coding skills I began to develop during my undergradudate career led me to where I am now.
