Hi! I’m Steve, a self-identified data enthusiast and master’s student at the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in Berlin. My interest in data is nothing new — I’ve been smitten with data as long as I can remember. As a child I would roam the yard, recording my observations of various plants’ heights, colors, and leaf sizes in rows and columns before I even knew how to work a computer.

As I matured, I began to view data in a new light. Data wasn’t just useful for describing the world, it could also be used to improve it. Data, when empirically analyzed, has the potential to reveal answers to many of society’s most intractable issues. It was this interest in data combined with a desire to obtain a macro-level view of society that drove me to pursue a degree in Economics at [Pepperdine University](https://www.pepperdine.edu/) in Los Angeles, California where I gained hands-on experience with compiling data sets, mining data, and writing code to perform regression analyses.

Upon graduating, I took up a position with the newly established United States Space Force as a procurement analyst where my team negotiated deals with space launch providers as part of the National Security Space Launch program. My experience crunching numbers in support of the public sector along with my desire to further develop my coding skills drove me to pursue my [MSc. in Data Science for Public Policy](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/mds) at the Hertie School in Berlin.  

As a first year student, I’ve been diving deeper into Python & R programming languages with a sprinkle of Bash, HTML, and XPath. This website serves as my attempt to showcase my portfolio as I continue to develop my coding skills.
