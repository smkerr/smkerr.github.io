I'm Steve, a data scientist and policy wonk with a passion for promoting data-driven public policy. Currently I’m a 2nd-year [MSc Data Science for Public Policy](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/mds) student at the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in Berlin, Germany. 

Originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, I moved to Los Angeles to pursue my Bachelor’s degree in Economics at [Pepperdine University](https://www.pepperdine.edu/) where I gained hands-on experience with compiling datasets, writing code, and performing statistical analyses to examine macroeconomic trends. Upon graduating, I took up a position with the newly established U.S. Space Force as a procurement analyst where my team negotiated deals with rocket launch providers. It was my passion for data-driven decision-making and its potential to positively impact policy-making that motivated me to pursue my [MSc. in Data Science for Public Policy](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/mds) at the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in Berlin. 

The program has given me the opportunity to rapidly advance my coding proficiency in Python, R, and SQL among other key competencies through a variety of projects with real-world public policy applications. Building on this foundation, I’ve broadened my experience by applying these skills in a variety of professional settings. I’ve worked as a data scientist at [CPC Analytics](https://www.cpc-analytics.com/) where I contributed to global health projects for the [World Health Organization Pandemic Hub](https://pandemichub.who.int/) and have also served as a teaching assistant for the Hertie School’s [*Introduction to Data Science*](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/study/course-catalogue/course/course/introduction-to-data-science) course. I’m currently working as a Student Researcher at the [Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC)](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/index.html) where I contribute to data science projects investigating the intersection between climate change and human health as part of the Applied Sustainability Science Working Group. 

This website documents my journey and showcases my [projects](/projects.html) as I continue to navigate the ever-evolving field of data science.
