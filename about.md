Hey there! I’m Steve, a data enthusiast and master’s candidate at the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in Berlin. My interest in data is nothing new — I’ve been smitten with data as long as I can remember. As a child I would roam the yard, recording my observations of various plants’ heights, colors, and leaf sizes in rows and columns before I even knew how to work a computer.

As I matured, I began to view data in a new light. Data wasn’t just useful for describing the world, it could also be used to improve it. Data, when empirically analyzed, has the potential to reveal answers to many of society’s most intractable problems. It was this interest in data combined with a desire to obtain a macro-level view of society that drove me to pursue a degree in Economics at [Pepperdine University](https://www.pepperdine.edu/) in Los Angeles where I gained hands-on experience with compiling data sets, mining data, and writing code to perform statistical analyses.

Upon graduating, I took up a position with the newly established U.S. Space Force as a procurement analyst where my team negotiated deals with rocket launch providers. My experience crunching numbers in support of the public sector along with my desire to further develop my coding skills drove me to pursue my [MSc. in Data Science for Public Policy](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/mds) at the Hertie School in Berlin.  

In my first year of the program, I had the opportunity to dive deeper into Python and R programming languages while gaining exposure to SQL, HTML/CSS/XML, and Bash. I'm currently putting those skills to use in my role as Junior Data Scientist at [CPC Analytics](https://www.cpc-analytics.com) where I support our partners at the [WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence](https://pandemichub.who.int/) with projects related to global outbreaks.

Data science is a vast field and I still have a lot to learn. This website is my attempt to showcase my portfolio as I continue to grow my skillset.
