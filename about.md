Hey there! I’m Steve, a data enthusiast and master’s candidate at the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in Berlin. My interest in data is nothing new — I’ve been smitten with data as long as I can remember. As a child I would roam the yard, recording my observations of various plants’ heights, colors, and leaf sizes in rows and columns before I even knew how to work a computer.

As I matured, I began to view data in a new light. Data wasn’t just useful for describing the world, it could also be used to improve it. Data, when empirically analyzed, has the potential to reveal answers to many of society’s most intractable problems. It was this interest in data combined with a desire to obtain a macro-level view of society that drove me to pursue a degree in Economics at [Pepperdine University](https://www.pepperdine.edu/) in Los Angeles where I gained hands-on experience with compiling data sets, mining data, and writing code to perform statistical analyses.

Upon graduating, I took up a position with the newly established U.S. Space Force as a procurement analyst where my team negotiated deals with rocket launch providers. My experience crunching numbers in support of the public sector along with my desire to further develop my coding skills drove me to pursue my [MSc. in Data Science for Public Policy](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/mds) at the Hertie School in Berlin.  

The program has afforded me the opportunity to rapidly upskill my knowledge of the Python and R programming languages along with SQL, HTML/CSS/XML, and Command Line. During my studies, I've had the opportunity to put those skills to use while working as a Data Scientist at [CPC Analytics](https://www.cpc-analytics.com) where I supported partners at the [WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence](https://pandemichub.who.int/) with projects related to global health emergencies.

Data science is a vast field with plenty of fascinating nooks to explore. This website serves to showcase my portfolio as I continue to grow my skillset.
